# TIC-TAC-TOE
A classic tic-tac-toe game created using python and python module TKinter.

In this project I learned a lot about basics of python and TKinter.

you can see that the are more than few type of files there for linux and windows seperately. That's because the width and height of the widgets in TKinter changed from linux to windows.

And download the photos to because to accommadate for the game icon and "X" and "O" replacements.

Make sure you download the correct file for your OS.
